# Ghost-Word-Game

Ghost is a written or spoken word game in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word, and usually some minimum is set on the length of a word that counts, such as three or four letters. The player who completes a word loses the round.

Here I have implemeted that game using Binary Search Algorithm for searching words faster from the dictionary in Android. The player winning will get 10 points rewarded to his score. This can go on upto unlimited gameplays and scores untill you explicitly click on the End button. The UI is very simple and elegant.
